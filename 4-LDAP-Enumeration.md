- Lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) is an Internet protocol for accessing distributed directory services
	- Directory servcies may provide any organized set of records, often in a hierarchial and logical structure, such as corporate email directory
	- A client starts a LDAP session by connecting to a directory system agent (DSA) on TCP port 389 and then sends an operation request to the DSA
	- Info is transmitted between the client and server using basic encoding rules
	- Attackers query the LDAP service to gather info , such as valid usernames, addresses, and departmental details
