- Different standards, frameworks and guides detail different methodologies to hack a system
- For example, EC Council defines five stages, known as the CEH Hacking Methodology
	- Reconnaissance
	- Scanning
	- Gaining Access
	- Maintaining Access
	- Clearing Tracks

- Stage 1: Reconnaissance
	- The first stage can be also known as footprinting
	- Both terms have same meaning
	- Involves gathering info about a target before scanning and gaining access
	- Includes both active and passive methods.

- Stage 2: Scanning
	- This stage has following main components:
		- Pre-Attack Phase: scanning the network for specific info based on the previous stage
		- Port Scanning: Identify any open ports
		- Extracting Information: Also known as enumeration
			- Identifying services on open ports, such as OS details, device type, system uptime, and user and shares info
		- Vulnerability scanning and analysis
 
- Stage 3: Gaining Access
	- Gaining operating system, application, or network level entry
	- Access to a system can be gained through:
		- privelege escalation
		- password cracking
		- buffer overflows
		- denial of service (DoS)
		- session hijacking

- Stage 4: Maintaining Access
	- Maintaining ownership and control of a compromised system and preventing the owners from locking the attacker out of the system
	- Also other hackers taking over system after you
	- Common method to maintain access is "backdoors"
	- Backdoors: Alternative route into the system
	- Programmers can introduce backdoors into their software for easy and convinient access
	- Another method is 'Rootkits'
		- enables privileged access to a computer
		- its presence is unknown/undetected
	- 'Trojans'
		- pieces of malware that look harmless but aren't
		- they disguise themselves wihtin legit software

- Stage 5: Clearing Tracks
	- Hiding malicious activity
	- Can include:
		- Disabling logging systems
		- Removing log files and entries
		- Removing unnecessary files, essentially eliminating evidence
