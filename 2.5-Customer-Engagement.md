- For any penetration test to succeed, customer engagement is required throughout the process
- For example
	- Whether test is against the internal or external systems
	- Whether an internal team conducts the test using staff from within the org, or whether the customer engages with an external third party
- At the start of the test, also known as pre-engagement:
	- Several components need to be established
	- Requires formal documentation

-Included in the scoping document:
	-Gaining written permission
	-Creating a scoping document
	-Detailing the rules of engagement
- May be separate aswell
- Penetration resting contract will also be required and this document may contain an NDA or it may be created independently
- NDA is designed to protect customer's information and provide a legal structure to help prevent penetration testers from disclosing information
	- Includes technical, system configuration, and operational info and weaknesses
	- Also includes non-technical info, such as processes and operational procedures

-Once customer has signed off on pre-engagement documents:
	-Penetration test can begin
	-During the test, tester will make notes of all activities and findings
	-These will be recorded and presented to customer as a report
	-Post-engagement documents may also be produced, including lessons learned and improvements for future tests
	-Mitigation strategies may also be provided in a separate document, sometimes included in pen test report
		-Just depends on pre-engagement agreement
