- There are multiple attack or hacking frameworks available:
		- MITRE ATT&CK
		- Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain
		- The MISP Framework
		- Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis
	- MITRE ATT&CK Framework
		- globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques
		- used as a foundation for develpment of specific threat models in private sector, govt, and cybersecurity product and service community
		- 14 tactic categories within ATT&CK for Enterprise are derived from the later stages of the seven stages of the Cyber Kill Chain
			- Pre-ATT&CK
				- Recon
				- Weaponize
			- Enterprise ATT&CK
				- Deliver
				- Exploit
				- Control
				- Execute
				- Maintain
	- Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis
		- offers a framework for identifying the cluster of events that are correlated
		- 4 main sections
			- Adversary: who
			- Victim: where
			- Capability: how
			- Infrastructure: what
	- PTES Methodology

			- Pre-engagement
				- Scoping
				- Legal & regulatory review
				- Logistics
				- Risk acceptance
			- Intelligence gathering
				- Passive reconnaissance
				- Active reconnaissance
				- Enumeration
			- Threat modelling
				- Identify HVTs
				- Map attack vectors
				- Assess impact
			- Vulnerability analysis
				- Automated scanning
				- Manual analysis
				- False positive triaging
			- Exploitation
				- Proof of concept exploits
				- Privelege escalation
				- Pivoting
			- Post-exploitation
				- Data extraction and analysis
				- Maintaining persistence
				- Lateral movement
				- Risk evaluation
			- Reporting
				- Executive summary
				- Technical details
				- Remediation guidance
				- Lessons learned

		- Planning/Pre-Engagement:
			- All methodologies highlight the importance of scoping, legal considerations, and planning before actual testing begins.
		- Intelligence Gathering / Discovery:
			- Regardless of the methodology, understanding the environment is crucial, whether it is networks, web applications, or physical premises.
		- Vulnerability Analysis:
			- Nearly all methodologies include scanning, enumeration, and analysis phases—whether explicitly or as part of a broader “discovery” or “assessment” phase.
		- Exploitation / Attack:
			- The core of any penetration test is demonstrating the feasibility of exploitation.
		- Reporting:
			- Each methodology underscores the importance of delivering clear, actionable findings to stakeholders.
	- Cyber Kill Chain Methodology
		- component of intelligence deriven defense for the identification and prevention of malicious intrusion activities
		- provides greater insight into attack phases, which helps security pros to understand the adversarys tactics, techniques
	- TTPs
		- Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
		- refers to the patterns of activities and methods associated with specific threat actors or groups

	- The Cyber Kill Chain methodology (process) specifies that all cyber attacks follow a specific sequence of stages. MITRE ATT&CK does not take this approach; it takes more of a TTP approach, providing more flexibility. The MISP framework provides a standardised method of collecting, storing and presenting information in a consistent way
