Key Terminology

- Asset
	- anything of value to a person or organisation
	- 2 primary assets
		- business processes & activities
		- information
	- 6 supporting assets
		- hardware
		- software
		- network
		- personnel
		- site
		- organisation structure

- Threat

	- can harm assets, information, processes, or systems
	- can be natural or human in origin and deliberate or accidental
	- threat is not a piece of malware
	- natural threats include
		- natural disasters
		- fires
		- heavy rain/wind
	- deliberate threats include:
		- script kiddies (inexperienced and unskilled hackers)
		- state sponsored hackers
		- organised criminal gangs and activists
		- many others
	- Look at threats as applying the attack, the source, and the origin of a cyber attack
	- They exploit the weaknesses in systems(vulnerabilities)
		- Ex) Poor memory management to gain access to an asset
	- A threat develops malware (the exploit) to compromise the poor memory management coding of the OS to expose the assets
	- Threats may also be known as:
		- Hackers
		- Threat-agents
		- attackers
		- adversaries
	- These four terms will be used interchangeably
	- Examples of exploits, also known as attack vectors:
		- Malware
		- Phishing emails
		- Botnets
		- Worms
		- ETC
		  
- Vulnerability

	- weakness or flaw in the system, exposing the associated assets
	- can be found in:
		- hardware
		- software
		- network
		- people
		- processes
	- examples
		- poor memory management
		- weak access control
		- incorrectly configured OS, database, or web apps

	- A threat, also known as the adversary or attacker, exploits the vulnerabilities to gain access to the assets

	- The EC-Council refers to hacking as exploiting system vulnerabilites and compromising the associated security controls to gain unautorised access to the system

- Hacking

	- hacking is exploiting or compromising digital systems, networks or people without permission
	- Ethical hacking is compromising systems with permission
	- There are differences between ethical hacking and penetration testing
		- Both exploit systems with permission from owners or members
		- Both exploit vulnerabilites in systems to obtain control, retrieve data, and secure access
		- Ethical hacker will want to hide and clear their tracks and maintain access, as a hacker would
		- Ethical hacker may also recommend mitigation solutions and security controls to address the vulnerabiliites identified

- Penetration Tester

	- a penetration tester is similar to an ethical hacker, but they will not usually attempt to hide or clear their tracks or recommend mitigation controls unless the customer request them as part of an engagement
	- Same meaning in this module to ethical hacker

- Red and Blue teaming

	- Red team: refers to testing the security of systems
		- offensive security such as ethical hacking
		- penetration testing and vulnerability assessments
	- Blue team: refers to defensive security
		- protecting, isolating
		- safeguarding systems, processes, and people
