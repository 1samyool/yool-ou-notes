The NIST Service Model is very simple an dignores much of the detail required to create and manage a cloud environment. Nevertheless, it does provide a useful starting point for some other models

Cloud Infrastructure - containing both a physcial layer and an abstraction layer
-The physical layer represents the actual hardware required to host the cloud service
- The abstraction layer represents the software deployed to implement the service

- The abstraction layer contains the three service models in a hierarchy to represent the fact that cloud services can be composed of one or more other cloud services

- So, a company that wants to offer an SaaS to the general public (Ex: mobile app) could do so by contracting for a PaaS, and the provider of the PaaS could build on the offerings of an IaaS

- However, the diagram illustrates that it would be possible to build an SaaS offering directly on the physcial layer, provided the functionality of the PaaS and IaaS layers is implemented as part of the application. This is similar to conventional web hosting in which the SaaS layer corresponds to the HTML and scripting, the PaaS layer to the web server, and the IaaS layer to the operating system
