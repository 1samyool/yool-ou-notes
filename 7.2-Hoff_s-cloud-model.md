Developed by Christopher Hoff to include in his professional presentations about cloud security

Much more detailed model of the cloud and brings to the fore the many elements hidden within the NIST and USCB and IBM models
![fdsafdsafda.JPG](../../_resources/fdsafdsafda.JPG)
Model is comprised of the three service models (IaaS, SaaS, PaaS) but HOff expanded on the details to make explicit all the functionality that needs to be provided for a fully functional cloud

The left-hand side of the diagram provides a layered view of the contents of each of the basic NIST service models

The middle of the diagram provides illustrative examples of what each layer provides

The right-hand side shows some illustrative commerical offerings of the layers

**IaaS**
- Five layers
	- Facilities
		- reperesents the facilites of the data center, such as power, cooling, and equipment rack space
	- Hardware
		- represents the actual computers, network, and data storage equipment
	- Abstraction
		- corresponds to the software kernels and middleware of the UCSB and IBM model and represents any hypervisor or cluster management software
	- Core Connectivity and Delivery
		- provides the essential services for network communication such as DNS, load balancing, security, and authentication
	- APIs
		- represents the application programming interface that gives the IaaS tenant the means to manage, monitor, and control all of their cloud components


**PaaS**
- Single layer
	- Intergration and Middleware
		- provides intergration services for the cloud, such as database, messaging and authentication
		- not tenant services, but services that support functioning of the cloud
		- For example:
			- before access is granted to use IaaS API, some form of authentication is required
			- Google App Engine
 

**SaaS**
- First layer in SaaS block comprises of three components
	- Data
	- Metadata
	- Content
- Second layer is:
	- Applications
		- represents the actual application hosted on the cloud such as a native or web application, or emulated
- The API layer provides the means to manage the hosted application, perhaps to update the application software, retrieve data to generate a sales report, or authenticate users prior to granting access to the API
- The topmost layer comprises two components
	- Prseentation Modality
	- Presentation Platform
