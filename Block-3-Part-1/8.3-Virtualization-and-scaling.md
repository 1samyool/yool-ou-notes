The combination of virtualisation and scaling are essential and fundamental to the cloud, because that is how elasticity is achieved

As demand grows, a new VM is launched, and it is removed when demand falls

The configuration template represents a cloud service that configures each VM as it is launched, defining the IP addresses, establishing the network, disk storage and access controls
The details can be varied for each server type, such as configuring a high-availability mode for the database

The cloud deployment represents one snapshot of the appliation's resources
	- Load balancer
	- Three web servers
	- The database in a master-slave, high-availability configuration
The application might start off with a single web server, but as demand increases a second web server is launched together with the load balancer
The two web servers have been derived from the same stored image, but individually configured based on the details of the template
If the load increases further another web serer can be launched, again the same image indiviudally configured

Scaling-out is not the only option
Theres also scaling-up, in which additional resources are added to a computer to increase its performance
In practice, scaling up is rarely encountered because few computers are bought with empty processor sockets and memory slots
However, virtualisation does not make scaling-up possible because most VMs dont use the maximum resources of the host computer
Typical server utilizes about 10% of the processing power


**Flavors**

In order to maximize the use of a single host, most cloud providers offer a limited number of guest configurations called 'flavors'

A flavor defines the number of processors, memory and local disk storage allocated to the guest

Flavors provide a standardized view of virtual machine resource requirements so that when a new VM is to be launched the scheduler simply looks for a host with enough resources for a given flavor
If at a later stage of development it is found that a guest requires moe resources, it can be associated with a larger flavor

overcommit ratio
	-the ratio of available virtual resources to available physical resources
	-default values are 16:1 for CPUs and 1.5:1 for memory
	-Ex)
		- Host with 10 cores could support guests up to a maximum of 160 vCPUs, provided the total virtual memory allocated is less than 1.5 times the actual memory

		

To scale up a VM, all that is necessary is to shut dwon the guest and relaunch it based on a flavor with more resources An image originally launched using the Medium flavor could be relaunched using the XLarge flavor
