The final part of the NIST cloud definition describes four different deployment models:
	- Private Cloud
	- Public Cloud
	- Hybrid Cloud
	- Community Cloud


**Private Cloud**
- The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organisation comprising multiple consumers (Ex: business units).
- It may be owned, managed, and operated by the organisation, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises
- Historically, private clouds were regarded as the only solution for organisation with a need to protect sensitive data or to comply with privacy and data protection legislation
- The typical solution was to create the cooud within a privae data center under the direct control of the organisation, but modern solution have made it possible to host private clouds in public data centers


**Public Cloud**
- The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public
- It may be owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or government organisation, or some combination of them
- It exists on the premises of the cloud provider
- This is the cloud that everyone knows and uses
- Cloud providers, such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, have constructed vast data centers to house the thousands of servers and associated networking equipment
- In order to simplify compliance with privacy and protection laws, the large cloud providers have built data centers in separate legal jurisdictions


**Hybrid Cloud**
- The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or propietary technology that enables data and application portability (cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds)
- The private-public hybrid cloud has become a popular solution for large enterprises that utilise a private cloud to ensure compliance with privacy and data protection legislation and at the same time gain the benefits of a public cloud for customer-facing applications
- Using modern cloud technologies, it is possible to co-locate the private and public elements within a single data center


**Community Cloud**
- The cloud infrastrucutre is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organisations that have shared concerns (Ex: mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations).
- It may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organisations in the community, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises
- Community clouds combine features of both private and public clouds
- They are private because the access is restricted to the members of the community, but public in that the members share data and applications
- One common scenario is a community of employees, partners and customers created so that customers and partenrs can provide better feedback to employees
