- Asset Identification
	- A1: Customer list: **confidentiality**, integrity, and **availability**
	- A2: Online Catalogue: integrity and **availability**

- Threats and their sources
	- Threat source: employee
		- Description: employees often have easy access to the computer system on which info assets depend. A disaffected, unscrupulous, or incompetent employee could disclose or damage such assets
		- Outcome: loss or damage of any information assets held on the system
	- Threat source: malicious external
		- Description: a malicious hacker, ever-present in electronic retailing, could attack the server
		- Outcome: interruption of access to, or disclosure, modification or loss of, any information assets held on the server
	- Threat source: earthquakes (Umbria is a seismically active area)
		- Description: an earthquake could damage the premises and amenities in which the information assets are housed
		- Outcome: destruction of, or interruption of access to, information assets held on the premises
	- Threat source: malicious person
		- Description: equipment theft
		- Outcome: loss, or loss of access to, information assets


- Combining threats and critical assets reveals the following potential vulnerabilities

	- If hackers can access a vulnerable server, for example if it is misconfigured and has never been patched, then the confidentiality and integrity security requirements of the critical info assets may be breached
	- If critical info assets are held on systems that are easily accessible to persons inside the firm, for example if the administrator's password is written down on a piece of paper stuck to the server, the confidentiality and integrity security requirements of the assets could be breached
	- If the firm's server is susceptible to earthquake damage, for instance if data on the server is not being backed up, then the availability and integrity security requirements of the assets could be breached
	- If the building is easy to break into or the system is liable to failure, then the availability secuirty requirements of the critical info assets may be breached


- In response to the report, the family asked the consultant to identify any actual vulnerabilities. The consultant identified the following:
	- The server had never been properly configured or patched, so there was an actuall vulnerability for hackers to take advantage of, compromising the information security requirements of both assets
	- The cellar was in an area of seismic activity, so there was an actual vulnerability to earthquake damage, compromising the info security requirements of both assets

- The consultant recommended the following risk treatment plan:
	- Backup copies of information, software and system images should be created and tested regularly in accordance with an agreed backup policy
	- The server should be properly configured and kept up to date with information security patches
	- The family should revisit their information security controls in a year's time to asses how they are working
