- Risk is the product of likelihood and impact.
	- Low risk: colored green - risks that were the least important to treat
	- Medium risk: colored amber - risk that should be treated if resources allow
	- High risk: colored red - risks that must be treated because they threaten the existence of the organization
- Through the risk combination table, each identified information secuirty risk is assigned red, orange or green depending on whether it is considred high, medium or low risk.
- Managing the risk means limiting it in some way so that, a red risk will become an orange risk, whcih will become a green risk, dpeending on the organizations risk appetite
- To do this we change one (or both) of only two factors
	- reduce the likelihood of a risk
		- Moving to the left in the risk combination table, so that high likelihood becomes medium or low likelihood
		- Reducing the likelihood of a risk to zero is a special case of reducing the risk
	- Reduce the impact of a risk
		- Moving down in the risk combination table, so that high impact becomes medium or low imapct
		- Reducing the impact of a risk to zero is a special case of reducing the risk
- The options and effect shown lead to the four ways in which information security risks can be treated
- Risks can be:
	- Avoided: only possible by disposing of the information asset in question
		- This is an important option as it is the only way that a breach of the risk's information security requirements for confidentiality can be absolutely guaranteed not to occur. However, disposal of an information asset will reduce its availability down to zero, meaning that nay value attributable to the asset will also be lost. All business processes that rely on this asset will have to be changed so that they do not rely on it.
	- Transferred: transferring a risk, for instance to an insurer, which does not reduce its likelihood, but from which there may be financial or other relief for any impact incurred
	- Controlled: strengthening weaknesses in an information asset's dependencies by applying information security controls
	- Accepted: the risk can be accepted when the cost of protection outweighs the resulting benefits. This is most likely when a risk is small
