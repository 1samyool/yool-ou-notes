If we were to treat the risk of a fire in the same way as that of an information security risk, we would see a fire as having both likelihood and impact.

We would then try to interpret the four options for treatment using a table - The effect of options for treating risk

Here, although the meaning of likelihood doesn't change, impact will mean losing valuable items of historical interest

- Looking at the treatment options in turn:
	- Avoiding 
		- Avoiding the risk of fire in a museum would mean removing all flammable things - including people! - which would negate the point of the museum
	- Controlling
		- Controlling the risk of fire is what a fire extinguisher and other safety equipment is designed to do
		- Don't lower likelihood of a fire
		- Only lowers impact
		- To lower risk on fire, restrictions may be needed on the types of material that are allowed to be brought into the museum, on whether smoking is allowed in the building, and on whether bags need to be checked for flammable liquids, etc.
	- Transferring
		- Transferring the risk is an interesting case
		- In general, an insurance company can spread the risk of a fire over many locations, because the risk of fire affecting one insured site is probably independent of the risk of another site burning down: the risk is **additive**, meaning that insuring an additional site does not alter the risk faced by other sites.
		- However, in the case of a museum like the Louvre, for which the paintings alone are worth millions, it would be difficult to find an insurer willing to take on the risk for affordable premiums
		- The mona lisa, for example, is uninsured
	- Accepting
		- Accepting the risk of a fire in a museum is, at the very least, contrary to health and safety legislation
		- In contrast, info security risks are shared. For example, if hundreds of emplyees use multiple copies of a single software package, all of them will suffer the same vulnerabilities. The risk of, say a virus spreading from one system to another is therefore very high: the risk is **multiplicative**


- Although we have presented four ways of treating information security risk, 'control' is often the best (or only) option because:

	- Often a risk cannot be avoided.
		- For example, if an information asset is key to an organizations misssion, the information asset cannot be disposed of
	- Although there is an increasing market in cyber insurance, transferring risk is not always feasible, due to excessively hgih premiums or insurers refusing to take on the risk
	- Accepting a medium-high impact or medium-high likelihood risk for a showstopper or significant asset is not a sensible course of action
