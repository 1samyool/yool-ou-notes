- **22.5 The future**
	- Internet connectivity is pervasive, but the 'dark side' of innovation is burgeoning as the rewards for a successful security breach increase
		- Given current trends, including the development of the IoT, not only will users plug new devices - mobile phones, game consoles, even clothing - into the internet and expect them to work, but also those users' lives will be monitored to an extent never before imagined
		- The future is one in which users connect to a computer network via a kaleidoscopic range of devices
		- Many such devices will run complex software, some of them will process personal information, and all of them will be vulnerable to attack
	- This connectivity will perturb current solutions to age-old problems; it will create new solutions to those problems; it will even allow currently unsolved problems to be solved for the first time
		- However, it will create new problems that we will struggle to solve
		- My best guess is that personal information security will form a fair proportion of those new problems
	- The internet is the doorway to your organization
		- Organizations must continue to adapt their information security policies to cater for new technologies and increasingly sophisticated attacks
		- Does defending against them mean predicting the future?
	- Information security is also a political tool
		- Nowadays we see many cases of information warfare - the process of attacking an opponent by reducing the availability to them of information resources
		- If relationships between countries deteriorate information security will become increasingly important on the world stage
	- Currently, organizations large and small, private and public, commerical or not, cross their fingers and repeat the information security mantra 'Please, don't let me be the first'
	- That is a foolhardy stance
	- You with the knowledge understanding and skills you have gained through your studies, are now part of your organization's inoculation against information security incidents
