- **22.4 Improving information security over time**
	- For out last information security topic we turn to the last clause of the standard, Clause 10: Improvement, and in particular, Clause 10.2: Continual improvement, which are implemented in control area A.18.2: Information security reviews
	- Organizations change and often sit within very volatile contexts that change around them very quickly. The changes that take place span everything from legislation and regulation to the announcement of new zero-day vulnerabilities; from thier use of new technologies to the appointment of new personnel; from finding new customers with different needs to finding new suppliers with different solutions
	- Change also covers the immediate need that arises when an organization is successfully attacked
	- With all that change, a single 'shot' at information secuirty will not be fit for purpose for very long - information security must be actively managed and improved. Hence the standard's requirement for continual improvement
	- What I have studied so far is a linear process leading from asset identification to controls
	- Continual improvement wraps thi slinear process in a loop so that experiences, learning and updated knowledge gathered during operations can be used to best advantage in the future. This continual improvement cycle runs periodically, tracking information security incidents, organisational changes and the changing environment to ensure that information security evolves to match any new needs.
	- **22.4.1 The plan-do-check-act cycle's approach to continuous improvement**
		- The plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle is an iterative approach to continuous improvement
		- Central to the PDCA cycle is the simple idea that we learn by doing
		- In the context of tackling a particular problem. the PDCA cycle relates to the idea that the act of building a solution to a problem leads to a better understanding of that problem, which cna in turn lead to building a new and better solution, and so on. In its generic form the PDCA cycle consists of the PDCA sequence 'plan' 'do' 'check' and 'act'

		- Although not appropriate for all types of problem, the PDCA cycle provides a way of tackling problems:
			- That exist in a complex and changing environment
			- That need an initial solution relatively quickly
			- For which there exist resources for continual improvement
		- Each of these characteristics applies to organizational information security:
			- The complexity of electronic business, the way that technology changes almost daily, the increasing awareness on the part of the public and their increasing expectations with constantly changing legislation and regulation make the environment in whcih information security protects an organisation very complex and changeable
			- For a new organization, for an organization facing the discovery of a zero day vulnerability, there is a great need for spped in finding and applying that first patch to bring thier information security defences back to adequate
			- An organization that understands the importance of information security will have been sold on the need for ongoing resources dedicated to continual improvement
	- **22.4.2 The four phases**
		- In the 'planning' phase the goal of the application of the PDCA is identified.
			- The plan phase answers the question:
				- What am I trying to achieve, and how can I achieve it?
			- This creates an initial plan for the whole PDCA cycle which with each iteration is revisited and chagned to cope with the changes in the environment
			- Criteria against which the effectiveness of the initial and future solutions cna be gauged are also agreed
			- The resources needed at this phase are a person or team whose understadning of the problem to be solved is sufficient to be able to break down the problem into a set of objectives and processes that will deliver to those objectives
		- In the 'do' phase the plan is put into action with the planned processes run and monitored against the objectives; this is where the action takes place, and this phase answers the question:
			- Can I satisfy my objectives?
			- The 'do' phase usually requires the lion's share of the resources as whole teams might be working in parallel on the range of planned processes. IN addition, the first time an organization 'does' there will be additional resources needed to set up the teams, processes, and moinitoring
			- After the first time the resource input will typically diminish as a steady-state process is discovered
		- In the 'check' phase the data gathered from the monitoring of teh 'do' phase are considered
			- This data can be compard with the objectives to see whether what was hoped for has actually been attained
			- Objectives that are complete can be discharged; obejctives that haven't been met can be analysed for lessons to be learned
			- The 'check' phase answers the question:
				- How do I know if what I did worked?
		- The 'act' phase the where the plan is improved.
			- Records from the 'check' phase help identify issues with the process
			- These issues mgiht include problems, non-conformities. opportunities for imporovement, inefficiencies and other issues that result in outcomes that are evidently less than optimal
			- Root causes of such issues are investigated, found and eliminated by modifying the process
			- Any risks can be re-evaluated
			- At the end of the 'act' phase the next 'plan' will be improved
			- The 'act' phase answers the question:
				- Given what I know, how can I improve the plan?
		- Every time we go through the PDCA cycle we are gaining knowledge of what our objectives actuallya re and of what works and what doesn't
		- The second time through the PDCA cycle should be better than the first; and each subsequent cycle should improve further.
		- This is what is meant when the PDCA cycle is described as a continual improvement process, and why we know both Shewhart's and Deming's names today!
		- Although the PDCA cycle is quite complex to describe, it is actually very natural: you may already use it, even if you do so without knowing that you do
	- **22.4.3 The PDCA cycle and information security**
		- The 2005 version of ISO270001, in use until 2015, mandated the PDCA cycle as the process model for continual improvement of information security. In 2015, this mandate to use it was removed. Despite this the PDCA cycle remains in use; according to Calder and Watkins.
		- For information security, the 'plan' question 'What should I do and in what order?' is answered with:
			- Create an information asset register
			- Perform an information security risk assessment
			- Choose controls that will manage the information security risk
		- The 'do' question 'Can I satisfy my objectives?' is answered with:
			- implement the information security controls that have been chosen
		- The 'check' question 'How do I know if what I did worked?' is answered with:
			- monitor the organization for new information assets
			- monitor and manage the inforamtion security incidents through the incident management process; reassess risks
			- monitor the environment for new threats
		- The 'act' question 'Given what I know, how can I improve the plan?' is answered with:
			- review the inforamtion security asset register, the risk assessment and the implemented controls, applying any lessons learned from the inforamtion security incident management process to improve each of them
