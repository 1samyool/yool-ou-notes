- The invevitability of information secuirty incidents and their impact on the organization should be dealt with at all times
- Your organization's response to attacks is the only thing that mitigates their impact and it is therefore critical to get it right
- The response to information security incidents is covered by Clause 16 of the guidance
- Control group 16 has only one control area
	- Control area 16.1: Management of information security incidents and improvements, with control objective:
		- To ensure a consitent and effective approach to the management of inforamtion security incidents, including communiciation on secuirty events and weaknesses
	- It contains seven controls:
		- A.16.1.1: Responsibilities and procedures
		- A.16.1.2: Reporting information security events
		- A.16.1.3: Reporting information secuirty weaknesses
		- A.16.1.4: Assessment of and decision on information secuirty events
		- A.16.1.5: Response to information security weaknesses
		- A.16.1.6: Learning from information security incidents
		- A.16.1.7: Colleciton of evidence
	- That the process exists means that it implements Controls 16.1.1: Responsibilities and procedures. Controls 16.1.2: Reporting information secuirty and events and 16.1.3: Reporting inforamtion secuirty weaknesses are implemented by the person that follows the process


- **22.3.1 Managing incidents**
	- Clause16 of the guidance is so important that it gets its own 'standard' document: ISO 27035: Information technology - Security techniques - Information security incident management: This has two parts
		- The first part, ISO27035-1: Principles of incident management, describes information security incident management as a structured approach to detecting, reporting, assessing and responding to incidents and applying lessons learned from previous information security incidents
		- The second part, ISO27035-2: Guidelines to plan and prepare for incident response, provides a detailed step-by-step approach to incident management. Although you have access to both parts of the standard through the OU library you will study only the first part in this module.
	- According to ISO-27035-1, 'the prime objective of information security incident management is to avoid or contain the impact of information secuirty incidents in order to minimize the direct and indirect damage to its operations caused by the incidents'
	- An information security incident management process involves many actors and teams each with different roles
	- They are the user/source, the point of contact, the internal incident response team (IRT) and the crisis handling team (including the external incident response team)
	- As shown, the process has 5 phases:
		- 1 - Planning and preparation
			- Making sure that each actor that will respond to an information security incident is in place with the resources they need to enact their role. This corresponds to Control A.16.1.1
			- 2 - Event detection and reporting
				- That possible inforamtion security incidents are detected and triaged efficiently and effectively. Events that are not inforamtion security incidents will be filtered out at this stage. This corresponds to controls A.16.1.2, A.16.1.3, and A.16.1.7
			- 3 - Event assessment and decision
				- That events identified as inforamtion security incidents are assessed and responded to in the most appropriate ways. This corresponds to Control A.16.1.4
			- 4 - Responses
				- That appropriate plans are enacted for crisis management and business continuity management. This corresponds to A.16.1.5
			- 5 - Lessons learned
				- That lessons are learned from information secuiryt incidents, for disocvered vulnerabiiites and for thier management. This corresponds to A.16.1.6
			 
- **22.3.2 Business continuity management**
	- It's estimated that 80% of organizations do not recover from disaster - rather, they struggle to get through it and then go out of business withing a year or two. For these organizations the next step after a disaster will have been unplanned and unrehearsed and will probably be unsuccessful. They won't know precisely which information assets had thier requirements compromised in the disaster. They will have no communications strategy to inform those affected by the disaster. Adn, as they fail to contain it, their diaster will become others
	- The 20% that do recover will have put in place a business continuity strategy, appropriately prioritised, agreed by all affected and rehearsed until it can run smoothly, and spring into action to follow the agreed steps. Trhough planning their disaster recovery plans they have ensured thier organization the best chance of continuing to do business
	- However, it's not just businesses that face disaster; public bodies and organizations in the third sector can do too
	- The possible types of disaster facing an organization are many and various. When they arise due to an information security incident, the rquirements for disaster and buisness continuity management are covered by Clause 17 of the standard
	- According to an old version of the standard (BS25999-1:2006), business continuity management (BCM) is a:
		- Business-owned, business-driven process that establishes a fit-for-purpose strategic and operational framework that:
			- proactively improves an organizaiton's resilience against the disruptiion of its ability to achieve its key objectives
			- provides a reheared method of restoring an organization's ability to supply its key
			- prodcuts and services to an agreed level within an agreed time after a disruption; and delivers a proven capability to manage a business disruption and protect the organization's reputation and brand
		- While the individual processes of business continuity can change with an organization's size, structures and responsibilities, the basic principles remain exactly the same for voluntary, private, or public sector organizations, regardless of thier size, scope or complexity
	- Since that was written, business continuity management (BCM) has moved from being described in detail as part of the standard and can now be found in ISO/IEC 27031, ISO 22313, and ISO 22301, each of which you have access to through the library (but you are not expected to read them as part of this module).

- **Control A.17**
	- **Control Area A.17.1**: Information security continuity with control objective: 'Information secuirty continuity shall be embedded in the organization's business continuity management systems'
	- **Control Area A 17.2**: Redundancies with control objective: 'To ensure availability of information processing facilities'
