- As controls, a clause in your contract of employment that states you will follow an acceptable use policy is very different from an organisation's use of backup. Controls vary in terms of where and whne they are applied and one important goal of information security is to layer controls so that they provide many different types of protection and remove any single points of failure
- That six types of control can be identified makes this layering easier
	- 1. Directive controls
		- Part of planning, attempt to change a person's behavior
		- Your contract of employment defnies how you are expected to act as an employee of your organization
		- As part of your contract you will have agreed to various codes of behavior, such as an acceptable use policy (AUP) for your organization's informaton systems, whcih aims to constrain your actions as a representative of your organization
		- Other examples are standards for configuring new machines before issue to direct the setup of new  machines, and having traffic lights on a boundary gate which direct by appealing to norms of behavior
			- Deterrent controls are a special type of directive control that attempt to change behaviors by linking an attack to a negative outcome
			- Making hacking a criminal offence is a deterrent to hacking, as is the warning banner that comes up on your computer saying your actions will be monitored
			- Directive controls are in some sense soft, they can be easily bypassed, and should only be used in low risk situations
		- 2. Preventative Controls
			- Earliest established defences which prevent an information asset from being attacked by protecting it: protecting an information asset behind a biometric check is an example of a preventative control.
			- Whereas directive controls only constrain behaviors, preventative control literally try to stop something bad from happening; a traffic light alone will not stop an intruder , but a traffic light together with a gated boundary fence will (depending on the fence).
			-  Needing a password to log on prevents those without passwords.
			-  Preventative controls are less easily bypasssed than directive controls, and are apporopriate for information assets or systems at higher risk
		-  3. Compensating Controls
			- Also called alternative controls
			- Again part of defneces and provide alternative measrues for an organization to fulfil an inforamtion security requirement
			- Compensating controls are used when the existing defences of a system do not meet an information security requirement
			- For instance, if youre new in a role that has access to critical information assets yoou might be assigned a supervisor to check what you do
			- That a traffic light will not stop an intruder might be compensated for by adding a gate, too
			- Compensating controls are harder still and are suitable for higher risk situations
		- 4. Detective Controls
			- Attempt to detect a breach as soon as possible after it occurs
			- good detection will occur sufficiently early to prevent the impact of a breeach being felt
			- IN password access, for example, logging each unsuccessful attempt to log in is a detective control; finding threee unsuccessful attemtps to log in. for instance, often leads to some period of time for which further log on attempts are not possible
		- 5. Corrective Controls
			- Part of early 'adjust and regrouping'
			- Apply some time after a breach has occured and try to make the best of a bad situation by lowering the impact as much as possible in the short term
			- Corrective controls are often the last line of defence against the impact of an attack, operating when deterrence, prevention and detection have not been effective
			- An example of a corrective control is an uninterruptable power supply (UPS), which turns on when power is lost
		- 6. Recovery Controls
			- part of late 'adjust and regrouping'
			- Attempt to repair any deamage that has been caused by an information security incident: backup is an example of a recovery control
			- After an inforamtion security incident that loses data, for instance, an organization may turn to their backup system to restore that data
 	- Directive, preventative, and compensating controls must be in place before an information security incident occurs to thwart it. Corrective, recovery, and deterrent control types are desinged to tidy up after an incident
