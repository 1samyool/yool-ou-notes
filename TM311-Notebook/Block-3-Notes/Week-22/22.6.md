- **22.6 Summary**
	- This part of block 3 has completed the discussion of risk control by looking at the risk treatment task in detail and at how to complete a statement of applicability based on the risk treatment.
	- Information security controls can be categorized into types and various principles can be helpful when selecting which controls to apply
	- Using both parts of the standard together with Calder and Watkins to choose controls to apply to risk selected for treatment during a risk assessment
	- Created entries for a statement of applicability by use of both parts of the standard together with guidance from Calder and Watkins
	- Through the module as a whole I have seen that inforamtion security touches on all aspects of an organization's existence
	- In particular, I have been shown to:
		- Look at your organization as an entity that has boundaries that regulate the flow of inforamtion assets between itself and its environment
		- Identify the pertinent external and internal issues that affect information security together with the requirements of interested parties
		- Consider, for your organization's information assets, their scarcity and shareability needs, and their security requirements of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (asset identification)
		- Determine the risks of breaches to those security requirements and which of these risk your organization needs most to address (risk assessment)
		- Develop and/or identify safeguards, countermeasures and controls that will best ensure that the risk are addressed and the security requirements are preserved (risk treatment)
	- I have learned how to protect my organization's critical inforamtion assets and have developed knowledge and understanding of the organization. I alos, have learned how to ensure taht my organization takes a more holistic view of inforamtion security
