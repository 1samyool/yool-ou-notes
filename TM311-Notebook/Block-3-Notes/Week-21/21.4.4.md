- The definitive entry for a vulnerability is found on CVE which is a register and not therefore used for discursive descriptions
- There will generally be more info on a vulnerability on the NVD website
- The NVD entry is long, but not particularly complex:
	- It begins with the title, original release date, last revision date and source
	- 'Overview' describes the vulnerability
	- 'Impact' provides a score under the Common Vulnerability Scoring System scheme
	- 'References to Advisories, Solutions, and Tools' lists links to sites where more information can be found
	- 'Vulnerable software and versions' lists each system configuration that is vulnerable
		- For each configuration entry, theres a list of configurations described under the Common Platform Enumerations naming scheme
	- 'Technical Details' lists the vulnerability type and provides a link to the DVE Standard Vulnerabilty Entry
- CVE identifiers are unique, common identifiers for publicly known information security vulnerabilities. Each CVE entry has:
	- a CVE identifier number (ex: CVE-2006-4765)
	- a brief description of the security vulnerability
	- a list of any pertinent references (ex: vulnerability reports and advisories)
- When a potential security vulnerability is discovered, a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) gives it a CVE identifier to identify it uniquely in the CVE database
- CVE identifer numbers have three components:
	- the prefix CVE, indicating that is is a CVE identifier number
	- the year in which the vulnerability was reported to the CVE
	- an identifier, unique within the year
