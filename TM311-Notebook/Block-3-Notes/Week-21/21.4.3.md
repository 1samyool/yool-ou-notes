- With thousands of researchers generating info about vulnerabilty assessment and millions of clients wishing to use that information, a register of vulnerabiliites is needed
- This role is filled by many registration services for knwon vulnerabilities
- Nessus uses some of the most complete vulnerability databases, including the following:
	- MITRE Corporation's Common Vulnerabiliity and Exposures (CVE) system, whcih provides a reference database for known information security vulnerabilities
	- The National Vulnerability Database (NVD), which builds on the CVE list entries to provide enhanced info, including fix info, severity scores, and impact ratings. NVD provides serach features over and above the CVE, such as locating the vulnerabilities by:
		- CVE identifier
		- operating system
		- vendor, product name and/or version number
		- vulnerability type
		- severity
		- related exploit range
		- impact
