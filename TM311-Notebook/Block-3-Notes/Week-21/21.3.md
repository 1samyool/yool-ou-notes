- Le Dolci Colline case
	- Firm had two critical assets
		- Customer list
		- Online catalogue
	- Only ONE vulnerabilty
		- Earthquakes, high risk of losing data
	- Closest match for this risk is Clause 12: Operations security
	- Clause 12 has 14 controls that ensure that information processing facilities are secure
		- A.12.1 Operational procedures and responsibilities – Objective: to ensure correct and secure operations of information processing facilities.

		- A.12.2 Protection from malware – Objective: to ensure that information and information processing facilities are protected against malware.

		- A.12.3 Backup – Objective: to protect against loss of data.

		- A.12.4 Logging and monitoring – Objective: to record events and generate evidence
	 
		-  A.12.5 Control of operational software – Objective: to ensure the integrity of operational systems.
	 
		-  A.12.6 Technical vulnerability management – Objective: to prevent the exploitation of technical vulnerabilities.
	 
		-  A.12.7 Information systems audit considerations – Objective: to minimise the impact of audit activities on operational systems.
	 
	-  The control group A.12.6: Technical vulnerability management, is another core information security control
-  **Clause A 12.6: Technical Vulnerability Management**
	-  Control objective:
		-  To prevent exploitation of technical vulnerabilites
	-  Control A.12.6.1:
		-  Information about technical vulnerabilities of information systems being used shall be obtained in a timely fashion, the organization's exposure to such vulnerabilities evaluated and appropriate measures taken to address the associated risk
	-  Control A.12.6.2:
		-  Rules governing the installation of softare by users shall be established and implemented
	-  Code of practice related to A.12.6.1:
		-  a current and complete inventory of assets is necessary for effective technical vulnerability management
-  **Clause A.14: Systems acquistion, development, and maintenance**
	-  Refers to organizational infrastructure (IT hardware), external systems, off-the-shelf systems, operating systems, business applications (IT systems, IT support) and user-developed systems
	-  Essentially, any systems acquisition, development, or maintenance that requires a written business case should, as part of that case, recognize the need to work with information security controls
	-  The need should be commensurate with the value of the information assets affected by the system
	-  This need stands alongside other statutory regulations
-  Since many organizations depend on external vendors for technical solutions, it might appear that the controls discussed in this section could justifiably remain unadopted
	-  However, with the increased use of the internet for communications, including for e-commerce, many of the controls the standard proposes for systems development and maintenance would have to be considered
