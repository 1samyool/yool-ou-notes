- Clause A.11 of the standards appendix lists the controls associated with physical and environmental security
	- There are 15 controls in the clause
	- Clear desk policy
		- Control A.11.2.9: Clear desk and clear screen policy
- Many authorities on information security rate physical controls higher than technological controls
	- One reason for this is that physical controls are some of the simplest, cheapest and most reliable to apply
	- They are also amongst the most effective and require little technological knowledge
- The simplest physical controls include protecting the physcial boundary of an organizationi, locking conifdential materials away, making backups of critical assets and storing them in a secure place
	- Combining physical controls provides the quintessential defense in depth strategy
- Schneier wrote
	- Physical countermeasures are often layered to reinforce each other and, in general, the sum is greater than the parts. â€¦ When everything works together, no single solution has to bear the total responsibility for deterring an attacker. And the required strength of each individual countermeasure depends on the others. A $5 door lock may be sufficient given the fence and guards. A $50 door lock may be wasteful given the open window nearby.
