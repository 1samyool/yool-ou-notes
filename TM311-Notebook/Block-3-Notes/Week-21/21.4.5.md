- An important field in an NVD entry is the impact score, expressed in the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), which is:
	- a free and open industry standard for assessing the severity of computer system security vulnerabilities. CVSS attempts to assign severity scores to vulnerabilities, allowing responders to prioritize responses and resources according to threat. Scores are calculated based on a formula that depends on several metrics that approximate ease of exploit and the impact of exploit. Scores range from 0 to 10, with 10 being the most severe. While many utilize only the CVSS Base score for determining severity, temporal and environmental scores also exist, to factor in availability of mitigations and how widespread vulnerable systems are within an organization, respectively.
- As of December 2019, there are 127,653 entries in the CVE database, this being an increase of more than 20,000 in 15 months
- For a single human to be aware of all the vulnerabilites that could compromise an organizations sytems is an impossibly complex task; auditing your home computer system against the CVE database can only be done with the assistance of a tool
