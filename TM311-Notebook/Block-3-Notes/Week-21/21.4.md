- Nessus is a scanning tool that identifies vulnerabilities on computers in a network and raises an alert if it discovers vulnerabilites that could lead to a malicious person gaining access
- Nessus began as an open source vulnerability detector
- Nessus works by running over 139.000 tests, and each test is designed to check one vulnerability
- Its checks cover:
	- vulnerabilities that allow a remote hacker to control or access sensitive data on a system
	- misconfiguration (for example: open mail relay, missing patches, etc.)
	- defaullt passwords, a few common passwords, and black/absent passwords on some system accounts
- Because the information security environment changes so rapidly, Nessus cannot jsut be released once and be left to do its work, it needs to be constantly updated as new vulnerabilities are found
	- Nessus is therefore based on an easy updatable plugin architecture
	- Plugins are written in the Nessus Attack Scripting Language (NASL) and contain vulnerability information, an algorithm to test for the presence of a security issue and the suggested remedies for patching that vulnerability
- As Nessus checks only for vulnerabilites, leaving the user to manage them, it isnt a complete security solution for a home computer

- **21.4.1 How Nessus works**
	- To learn how Nessus works, it is necessary to understand hwo different services (such as a web server, SMTP server, FTP server, etc.) are accessed on a remote server
	- When computers establish a communications link, they must establish a pair of sockets - one at each end of the link
	- The socket contains both the IP number of the recipient and a 16-bit port number at that destination
	- Ports can be thought of as being analogous to mailboxes at the entrance to a large block of flats
		- Every flat shares the same street address (the IP number), but each flat has its own unique number (the port)
		- To send a letter to the correct flat, it is necessary for the sender to know both the street address and the flat number
		- Ports are assigned numbers from 0 to 65535
		- Software applications send and receive info using predefined port numbers (for example: msot web traffic is passed on port 80, SMTP (mail traffic) uses port 25)
		- Ports below 1024 are called the well-known ports and are reserved for standard services
		- More than 300 have already been assigned
	- Some port numbers are not only predefined but their existence is well known, and many pages on the internet givve a complete list of their allocation
		- For example, the internet assigned numbers authority (IANA), which is tasked with allocating IP numbers and top level domains, provides a complete list of the port numbers used by TCP/IP
	- Nessus knows the default assignments and tests a service it expects to see at each port for vulnerabiliities
		- So essentially, Nessus asks a machine a number of questions and interprets the answers, looking for vulnerabilities
		- The questions asked and the interpretation of the responses given are defined by the plugins
		- The results are reported to the user as a vulnerability report
	- Even though Nessus can scan your home network for vulnerabiliites, we will focus our attnetion on a single machine on whcih it will be installed
		- However, under the terms of the Essentials edition, you are allowed to scan your home network
