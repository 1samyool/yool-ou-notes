- People are responsible for protecting important informaton assets and it is human 'weakness' that leads to a fair proportion of information security breaches
- Clause 7: Human resource security deals with human weaknesses. It consists of three control areas. Although the whole of Clause 7 is important, you will study only control area A.7.2, specifically Control A.7.2.2 Information security awareness, education and training.
- We approach this in two steps:
	- 1. Read what the standard and guidance say about this control
	- 2. Implement, partially, this control as it applies to your work colleagues

- Three control areas:
	- A.7.1: Prior to employment
		- Ensure that employees and contractors understand their responsibilities and are suitable for teh roles for which they are considered, including screening
	- A.7.2: During employment
		- Ensure that employees and contractors are aware of and fulfill thier information secuirty responsibilites, including awareness, education, and training
	- A.7.3: Termination and change of employment
		- Protect the organization's interests as part of the process of changing or terminating employment
