- Among the 114 controls in the standard there are some controls - in the areas of leadership, for instance - that should be a part of every statement of applicability. These are the controls that enable inforamtion secuirty
- As all statements of applciability will contain these controls as entries, they also serve as useful examples of how a statement of apllicability entry should look
- These core controlls are spread liberally throughout the standard's control Annex A:
	- Controls A 5.1.1: Policies on infromation security and A5.1.2: Review of the policies for inforamtion secuirty from control group A.5.1: Management direction for inforamtion security
	- All controls from control group A.6.1: Internal organization
	- Control A 7.2.2: Information security awareness, education and training from control group A.7.2: During employment
	-  Control A.8.1.1: Inventory of assets from control group A.8.1: Responsibility for assets
	-  Both controls from control group A.12.6: Technical vulnerability management
	-  Control A.16.1.6: Learning from information security incidents from control group A.16.1: Management of information security incidents and improvements.



**20.3.1 Control group A.5.1: Management direction for information security**
- Control group A.5.1: Management direction for information security has the control objective:
	- To provide management direction and support for information security in accordance with business requirements and relevant laws and regulations
- Controls A.5.1.1: Policies on information secuirty and A.5.1.2: Review of the policies of information security are concerned with establishing and reviewing information secuirty policies
- Since control A.5.1.1 and A.5.1.2 concern the management's decision to develop information secuirty, the statement of applicability for every organization should contain entries derived from the requirements for Controls A.5.1.1 and A.5.1.2 to indicatee that these controls have been adopted
- If they werent to have been adopted, then we wouldn't be trying to improve information security


**20.3.2 Control group A.6.1: Internal organization**
- Like control group A.5.1, control group A.6.1 also relates to organizational motivation for inforamtion security
- It requires the organization to 'initiate and control the implementation and operation of information security within the organization'
- The statement of applicability should contain entries for each of A.6.1's five controls each fully adopted:

**20.3.3 A.8.1.1: Inventory of assets**
- Another core control is the creation of a register of inforamtion assets for your organization
- Unless your org is very small, your info asset register with only five items is an incomplete implementation of an asset register, even if the adoption of the asset register is full
- This can be reflected in the statement of applicability entry for it
