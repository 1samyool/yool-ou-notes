- With your statement of applicability, you have begun your implementation of the standard's information security controls; specifically, you are implementing the requirement contained in Clause 6.1.3d.
- Many of the controls associated with humans are implemented through the development of policy - for instance, an access control policy (Control A.9.1.1), a clear-desk-and-clear-screen policy (Control A.11.2.9), an acceptable-use policy (Control A.8.1.3), or through education and training (Control A.7.2.2).
- Controls associated wiht systems, on the other hand, require technical implementations, such as cryptography (Contraol group A.10.1), the management of technical vulnerabilities (Control A.12.3.1), the last of which you have already seen.
- Environmental controls have implementations in the physical world, such as imposing a physical security perimeter (Control A.11.1.1)
- We now consider various examples across human, systems, and environmental controls to give you experience of implementing them for real.
- I will study:
	- The design and implementation of education materials to teach your colleagues
	- The design of access controls
	- The development of a clear desk policy
	- The management and application of techinical controls
	- Incident management and business continuity
- Other than the clear desk policy, each of these will result in something to submit as part of TMA3
- The first case deals with control risk from internal human sources
