- Clause 6 of the standard includes the requirement that a **statement of applicability** be produced
- The statement of applicability is an important document based on the organization's risk assessment and other information
- It contains:
	- A statement as to which controls are applicable to improve organizational information security - hence the name and for each control
		- The justification for the inclusion of each considered control
		- Whether these controls are implemented or not
		- The justification for excluding any of Annex A controls
- In the real world, the statement of applicability documents the decisions reached on which controls have been chosen to treat the information security risks faced by an organisation and those which have not, together with reasons for each decision whether adopted or not.

**20.2.1 Your statement of applicability**
- The statement of applicability records, among other things, the otucomes of the selection of controls that will be implemented from the 114 in ISO270001.
- It justifies the decisions taken, particularly when those decisions have led to a control not being adopted.
- This information is vital for those auditing the compliance of your organization's information security against the standard, and also for those developing information security in the future
- For each control considered, there should be a record of whether the control is applicable to the organization and, if applicable, whether it is to be adopted:
	- In full - meaning that there is no deviation from the standard's guidance for its implementation
	- Partially - meaning that the control is applied, but not as suggested by the standard
	- Not adopted - meaning that the control is not adopted for implementation
- In cases of partial or no adoption the reasons for the decision should be given. Reasons might include:
	- The risk has been accepted or transferred to a third party - an insurer, for instance
	- The cost of implementing the control is prohibitive - that is, the cost-benefit ratio doesn't stack up
	- While the control is suggested as being applicable, in reality it's not, due to some complicating factor which can then be described


**20.2.2 The structure of your statement of applicability**
- Essentially a statement of applicabilty consists of:
	- A short intro
	- An entry for each of the 114 controls listed in Annex A of the standard, similar to the one you completed in activity 20.1
	- Entries for any other controls adopted
	-
