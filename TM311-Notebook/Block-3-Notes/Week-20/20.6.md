- Access control is not generally considered a core information secuirty control: although it may be adopted in small organizations, it is more effective in large organizations where many thousands of information assets (and other resources) controlled
- However, it is such an importune topic that this modules expects me o be able to create a simpel access control policy for an organization
- Control objective for Clause A9.1:
	- To limit access to information and information processing facilities
- Control A.9.1.1 states:
	- an access control policy shall be established, documented and reviewed based on business and information security requirements
- Control A9.1.2 states:
	- users shall only be provided with access to the network and network services that they have been specifically authorized to use

**20.6.1 Access control and its implementation**
- Access control is fundamentally concerned with defining who can perform which tasks with impact on which resources.
- A resource may be either a physcial resource, such as a room, a paper file in a filing cabinet or a desktop computer: or a logical resource, such as a document file, an email or a record from a database
- In general, resources will be inforamtion assets whose confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements need to be met

**20.6.2 Identity and identity claims**
- Understand that a subject may have many identities, each distinct

**20.6.3 Authentication and authorisation**
- Authentication and authorisation are sometimes confused
- Authentication
	- Binding of an identity to a subject
- Authorisation
	- Being sure a require to use a resource is valid
- To authenticate, a number of types of factor may be used, such as:
	- Knowledge factors: something that is known only by subject, such as a password
	- Possession factors: something that is possessed only by the subject, such as a badge
	- Biometric factors: something that is an inherent characteristic only of the subject, such as a fingerprint
	- Contextual factors: a location where only the subject is to be found, such as when the subject uses a particular device in a known location

- An identity claim that depends on only one of these factors is less secure than depending on many of them
- In multi factor authentication, we can use many such factors
- Apples 2FA, relies on a user Id and password (knowledge factor) and being able to receive a text message to a telephone number (possession factor)
- Authorisation, in contrast, is the means by which we can be certain that a request by a subject to use an object in a particular way is valid
- Example of withdrawing from an ATM:
	- Authorisation of my request to withdraw money depends not only on authentication, but on thier being sufficient funds in my account
	- While authorisation depends on authentication of the subject, there is more to it that that: both the object and the use to wchih it is to be put must be considered as well
- Authorisation relies on the precise specification of a subject's rights of and/or priveleges to access to a resource, and this bring us, finally to Clause A.9: Access control and its implementation as access control policies
