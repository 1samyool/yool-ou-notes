- The overview to the standard defines access control as a:
	- Means to ensure that access to assets is authorized and restricted based on business and security requirements
- Authorisation using access control limits access to inforamtion and information processing facilities - that is, access control is about managing access to information resources on the part of people, and other agents such as software
- To do this, the subjects that are able to access any particular inforamtion resource must be clearly defined
- This is thefucntion of an access control plicy: to allow a decision as ot whether or not a request form a subject to interact wiht an information resource or information system should b egranted
- Thus, an access control policy allows an access control decision to be made
- This decision is based on several pieces of information and will result in a permit or deny response
- These decisions are sometime called 'permissions' as they grant or withhold permission
- The **object**, which is access control speak on this module for the information assets to which access is wished
- The **action**, whcih simply is what the subject would like to do to the object
- The basic actions that can be performed on an information asset are those defined by the asset lifecycle that is, Store, Create/Receive, Access/Use/Change, Maintain, Transmit, Destroy and Archive.
- Each of these actions should be interpreted, however, so that it makes sense in context
- Actions on a particular asset should, therefore, be described as part of an access control policy
- Note that while it is possible to extend access control policies to non electronic assets, the primary use fo such policies is for ocntrolling access to electronic information assets, accessed by electronic means
- To simplify the following, then, for electronic assets we can use the popular 'create, read, update, destroy' access methods with their welll understood meanings


**20.7.1 Access policy defaults**
- Facebook has an access control policy, as does GCHQ; as you might guess, they differ substantially
- One of the biggest differences is on how they make a decision when there isn't enough information offered to make a decision, which brings us to access policy defaults
- There are two possible default policies: Facebook has a default open policy; while that for GCHQ is a default closed policy
- Defulat open policy means permit access unless specifically prevented
- Defulat closed policy measn deny access unless specifically allowed

**20.7.2 The least-privelege principle**
- Another important choice for desinging access control policies is baed on the principle of least privelege
- Least privelege states that each subject should only be given sufficient authorisation to perform their job
- Although the correc tterms are subject and object, form now on we will talk about users and information assets

- 1.2 You may only use computers and computer accounts that you have been officially authorised to use
- 1.9 Access granted to university systems must follow the 'least privelege' principle, only granting access required for the user's job role
- 1.10 Access to systems must be granted through a defined process, following an industry standard
