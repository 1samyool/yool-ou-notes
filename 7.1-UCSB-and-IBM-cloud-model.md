SOA provides the basis for the UCSB and IBM layered cloud model which was developed to aid in the exploration and teaching of cloud computing

The model comprises five layers, two more than the NIST model 

The physical layer has been split to separate the software that manges the hardware from the hardware itself

The hardware layer of this model is classed as a service, hence the label HaaS, to make it expliticit that the cloud provider maintains, and updates the hardware as a service for the consumer

The software kernels and middleware layer represents the systems sovtware that creates, managaes, and schedules the abstraction layer software. The tenant of a higher-level srvice (SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS) has no visibility of thi smanagement software other htan through the limitations and controls it might impose on the options provided. 

The layers within the abstraction layer are essentially those we saw in the NIST model, but with one significiant difference; the infrastructure block is presented in finer-grained detail as three distinct services:
	-IaaS
	-DaaS (Data storage as a service)
	- CaaS (Communication as a service)
Splitting the services within the layer makes them explicit and enables them to be offered as discrete services

For example, not all applications need the features of a database, but those that do need them can simply plug them in using a DaaS

Similarly, if special networking features are reqiured such as high bandwidth, encryption, or isolation, tehy can be added by means of a CaaS

Making services explicit, but separate, increases the flexibility offered to the cloud tenant and creatses the opportunity for increasing the value added by the provider
