One of the critical components of a penetration test is defining a "Clear Scope"

The scope should state the organisational structure:

- For example:
	- Facilities
	- Users
	- Groups
	- Department
- All should be tested

- It should also include the technical boundaries or attack surface
	- Web, email, file or database servers, desktop computers, network components, etc should all be evaluated
 
- The scoping process should involve the relevant people across organisations (if involved/required) with stakeholders such as:
	- The customer (client)
	- Risk/asset owners
	- Appropriate management personnel
	- Required non-technical staff
	- Technical staff
	- External providers/suppliers
	- Representative of the penetration testing team
- The required stakeholders will vary from org to org
- Other personnel may also be required
- Any special requirements specific to the customer/client must also be identified
	- For example: Testing out of hours
   
 
**Test Basis**
- Tests can be carried out by tester armed with varying amounts of information about your system
	- Transparent or Open-Box testing: (Also known as Whitebox testing)
		- Full info about the target is shared with the testers
		- Confirms the effiacy of internal vulnerability assessment and management controls by identrifying the existence of known software vulnerabilities and common misconfigurations in an organisations systems
	- Opaque or Closed-box testing: (Also known as Blackbox testing)
		- No info is shared with the testers about the internals of the target
		- Performed from an external perspective and is aimed at identifying ways to access an organisations internal IT assets
		- This more accurately models the risk faced from attackers that are unknown or unaffiliated to the target organisation
		- Lack of info can also result in vulnerabilites remaining undiscovered in the time allocated for testing
